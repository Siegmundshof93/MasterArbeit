\section{Top Level Requirements}
The PDU shall be able to provide sufficient power to fulfill requirements of subsystems and payloads using common regulated voltages 3.3 V, 5 V and regulated battery voltage 7.4V. Top level requirements are given by GOS specially for the Descartes Mission. There are 22 top level requirements which are shown in the Tab. \ref{Tab:req1}.
