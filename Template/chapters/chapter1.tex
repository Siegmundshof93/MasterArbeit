\chapter{Introduction\label{cha:chapter1}}
Due to significant amount of new Missions, German Orbital System took a step up to create a type of satellite bus for 6U satellite.  As a result of updating the bus from 3U to 6U, satellite functions have improved, which opens up the possibility for more subsystems and components, as well as for payloads. The configuration of the separate power distribution unit made it possible to place more components on which the number of working subsystems and payloads increased. Development process of the satellite including EPS is taking a sizable amount of time, to use time more efficient was decided to divide the EPS in to two units and create an universal Power Distribution Unit which is admissible for 6 Unit as well as for a 3 Unit CubeSats. 
 

\section{Motivation\label{sec:moti}}
Nowadays most of the companies designing their Electrical Power System boards for a nano cubesats as whole unit, consisted of all important devices for power management. This configuration is common and allowed to create space for a hardware in the tiny cubesat which is essential for a nano satellites due to its limited size and mass. 
\\  Despite the fact that mechanical space of the satellite is important, the space on the EPS board is limited for a components which is narrowing satellite possibilities with bigger missions and more developed bus. 
The motivation of this research is to find the optimal solution of the Power Distribution Unit architecture of Electrical Power System for the 6U CubeSat. Development of Power Distribution Unit will make a responsible use of time for a next missions, by development only a Power Processing Unit, which will be configured for each mission individually.\\
One unit configuration is a common type of an EPS design, which is mostly used by nano cubesat developers. This type of EPS design allowed to combine all components of the EPS in one unit to save mechanical space for the rest of the bus hardware and a payload of a nano cubesat. Second type of technology is a separated type of the EPS which is divided in to PPU which is responsible for a power generation from a solar panels, battery charging and balancing as well as power processing and power convertation and PDU which has a function of the power distribution. PDU consist mostly of switchers and current sensors, this architecture allowed to place significant amount of switchers and connectors for a payloads, which are necessary for a missions requiring amount of payload connections which will not be enough for a standard one unit EPS board type. \\

\section{CubeSat Concept}
The Cubesat concept was developed by California Polytechnic State University and Stanford University. The concept provides opportunity to reduce the time and cost for development a satellite. There are different types of the CubeSats, One-unit (1U) CubeSat is a 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 113.5$\pm$0.1 mm cube with the maximum weight of 1.33 kg. Two-unit (2U) CubeSat is a 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 227$\pm$0.2 mm cube with the maximum weight of 2.66 kg. Three-unit (3U) CubeSat is a 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 100$\pm$0.1 mm $\times$ 345.5$\pm$0.3 mm cube with the maximum weight of 4 kg.\\

 This Master Thesis will describe subsystem development of 6U satellite that have dimensions 360$\times$240$\times$120 and maximal weight of 8kg.\\ 

\section{Goals of Present Work\label{Goals}}
The goals of this work are determined by following bullet points:\\ \\
$\bullet$ \ Develop the Power Distribution Unit which meets the requirements of the Descartes Mission.\\ \\
$\bullet$ \ Design the flexible layout for the Power Distribution Unit in order to adjust the PCB for the future missions.\\ \\
$\bullet$ \ Test the PDU by using the ground test equipment such as PSU, STM32 Nucleo-kit.\\ \\
$\bullet$ \ Test the PDU by using fly-hardware.\\ \\

In addition, the schematics and layout design has to be made to generate and present information in such a way that it could be picked up by the next wave of engineers.
