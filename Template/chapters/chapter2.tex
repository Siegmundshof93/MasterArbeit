\chapter{Background: Electrical Power System Distribution Board \label{cha:chapter2}}
This section is intended to provide essential knowledge on Electrical Power System that will help to explain the development of Power Distribution Unit.
Therefore, an overview of the EPS will be presented. The EPS power and data lines include protocols will be explained as well. Another subsection of this chapter provides a power consumption according to a modern space components. Also power budget of the satellite will be developed based on the power consumption of the modern space components.

\section{Electircal Power System Overview \label{sec:tech}}
The Electrical Power Subsystem is a vital part of a CubeSat-Bus. It is responsible for generation and storage of energy, the processing of electrical power to a defined state and the distribution of power to all satellite subsystems. The EPS is a main, essential and frequently form the third of total spacecraft mass. Power generation technology combine a solar cells, charger. Power storage typically includes a batteries; primary batteries (non-rechargeable), or secondary batteries (rechargable). Power distribution consist of power switchers, which facilitate power control to a subsystems of the spacecraft.

\subsection{Power generation \label{sec:tech}}



Yost\cite{1} Solar power generation is the most used method for the nano satellites to generate a power. Sollar cells are build of thin silicon disks (semiconductor wafers)  which convert the energy of a light into electric current. Solar intensity of a solar array is light availability of the sun, which can vary according to a distance from the sun as well as angle of a projected surface area between the sun and a solar array.  
\\
\noindent\hspace*{3mm} Alia-Novobilski\cite{2} The most common manufactured type of cells are single junction cells. Single junction type is commonly used on the Earth applications. Due to severe sensitivity to a space radiation energy and relatively low efficiency, single junction type is not preferable for a space applications. Although single junction solar cell is relatively cheap to design, modern spacecraft use a multi-junction solar cells. Manufactured of a light-absorbing materials, multiple layers are much tolerant to a radiation in a space environment and more efficiently  Yost\cite{1} "convert specific wavelength regions of the solar spectrum into energy, thereby using a wider spectrum of solar radiation". 
Green\cite{3} In the space industry, triple-junction solar cells are the most common tu use due to their high efficiency and relatively affordable cost compared to an other types of solar cells.

\end{figure}

Solar cells are usually interconnected to a solar array to get the desired power. Configuration of the solar array is flexible, such that it allowed adjustment of the cells connection. To achieve the desired voltage, solar cells get interconnected in series (strings). To achieve the desired current, solar cells get interconnected in parallel.\\

Solar cell is strongly effected by a temperature. Honsberg\cite{5} "Increases in temperature reduce the band gap of a semiconductor, thereby effecting most of the semiconductor material parameters. The decrease in the band gap of a semiconductor with increasing temperature can be viewed as increasing the energy of the electrons in the material."\\
\\
Brieß\cite{6} The dependency of a temperature to the electric power can be described as:\\ \\ \\

\begin{equation}
P = P_{ref} [ 1 - K_{P} ( T - T_{ref}) ]
\end{equation}
	\\
	\\
where:\\
     $P_{ref}$ - Power at reference temperature\\
     $K_{P}$ - Correction factor of power losses, 0.005$K^{-1}$\\
     $T_{ref}$ - Reference temperature ( e.g. 25\textdegree{}C)\\

During the circuit design of the solar panels, it is important to consider the redundancy and a cause in which one of the cells will be damaged. For that reason diodes are used. The diodes ensure the power can bypass a damage solar cell. On the fig 2.5 shown that the diodes D1 and D2 are placed in th parallel with the solar cells. Diode D3 which also observed on the figure 2.3 is used to prevent the reverse current. Reverse current has a negative effect on the solar panel efficiency. When reverse current occurs, one effect is that current it's drawn from the batteries, therefore, discharging them. Secondly, reversed current adds additional current to the affected solar cell which shifts the maximum power point.

\subsection{Power storage \label{sec:tech}}



Yost\cite{1} During the the mission duration, solar energy is not always available due to eclipse. For this cause primary and secondary batteries used to store power. All batteries are classified according to their chemical characteristics. For a short mission duration (up to one week) usually used primary type of batteries due to it's lack of recharge opportunity. the common chemical type of a primary battery is a silver-zinc, which is easier to handle, Yost\cite{1} "however there is also a variety of lithium-based primary batteries that have a higher energy density including: lithium sulphur dioxide (LiSO2), lithium carbon monofluoride (LiCFx) and lithium thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) 20."\\
\\
Secondary-type batteries are rechargeable and provide an energy on demand. Secondary-type batteries are connected to a primary energy source of the satellite (usually solar panels) via battery charger. This type include: nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-hydrogen (NiH2), lithium-ion polymer(LiPo), lithium-ion(Li-ion).
\subsubsection{Nickel Cadmium \label{sec:tech}}
 Buchmann\cite{7} Nickel Cadmium is a type of rechargable batteries using nickel oxide hydroxide and metallic cadmium. This chemical connection allowed battery to well perform by working in the savage conditions such as low or hot temperature. NiCd battery is the type which prefer to be charge fast instead of slow as types of secondary batteries. Full periodic discharge of a NiCd is an important process and necessary for battery performance. In case of absence  Buchmann\cite{7} " large crystals will form on the cell plates (also referred to as memory) and the NiCd will gradually lose its performance."

\subsubsection{Nickel Hydrogen \label{sec:tech}}
Buchmann\cite{7} Nowadays Nickel Hydrogen batteries are mostly used in the satellite applications where long time operation needed. The development of the NiH2 battery started in early 1970 year. In that time metal hybrid alloy was unstable, what slowed down development of the NiH2. In 1980 new alloy was established and stable enough to use it in the cell. 
\cite{10}"The replacement of cadmium with hydrogen electrodes has double the energy of Ni-Cd, but the specific energy of Ni- H2 is similar to Ni-Cd because of the cylindrical configuration of the pressure. The first Ni- H2 battery was used in a GEO (geostationary mission) Intelsat V in 1983.  Almost all GEO spacecrafts now use Ni-H2 batteries. The first NASA LEO spacecraft to use Ni-H2 was in 1990."


Wenige\cite{8} Despite the fact that memory effect on NiH2 is undoubtedly less than on a NiCd batteries, it still exist and needs a special treatment in order to accommodate the normal level of the battery. Wenige\cite{8} "Typical calendar life of more than 20 years can be reached by NiH2, i.e. five years ground storage plus 15  years  orbital  life  in  GEO."

\subsubsection{Lithium Ion \label{sec:tech}}

Buchmann\cite{7}Today lithium ion batteries is the most progressive and most promising batteries. Lithium is the lightest metal and able to provide the biggest energy density per weight. The energy density of a Lithium Ion batteries is about two times bigger then a NiCd. In addition, discharge characteristics of a Li-ion are similar to a NiCd, which offers a save utilization of a Li-ion batteries. Another advantage of a Li-ion batteries is a high cell voltage, which allows to allows to keep power properties with the light mass. Despite the fact that Li-ion batteries have many advantages, they also have their drawbacks. Li-ion batteries are very sensitive to an overcharge as well as an over discharge. For that reason Li-ion batteries usually used with protection circuits, which limit the peak voltage. In addition Li-ion batteries are prone to age even if not used Buchmann\cite{7} Over two or perhaps three years, the battery frequently fails.

\subsubsection{Lithium Polymer \label{sec:tech}}

In 1970, when the original design of lithium polymer batteries was invented, dry solid polymer electrolyte was used instead of  porous separator. Dry polymer design, allowed to simplify manufacture process and the most important - to have a thin thickness geometry. However Dry solid polymer electrolyte experienced poor conductivity due to internal resistance of a the battery. Thereby, gelled electrolyte has been added to enhance ion conductivity. LiPo batteries have a slightly lower energy density and amount of charge/discharge cycles compare to Li-ion batteries. Nonetheless LiPo batteries have a bigger overcharge tolerance, which making them more robust to overcharge conditions.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Charging}

Santoni\cite{13}The hight capacity and low weight make Li-ion batteries very well suited for a nano satellite space applications. Nonetheless performance and safety charging issues must be taking into account. Insidor\cite{14} The chargie of a LI-ion batteries is very strict on the correct settings, mostly due to a high sensitivity to a overcharge. Typical Li-ion battery voltage per cell can vary from 4.1 to 4.3, which is defined in the datasheet. However, typical and most common value is 4.2V. Exceed of a battery voltage limit will increase capacity, but will also stress a battery, which can seriously harm a cell and and significantly reduce battery performances.\\ \\
Li-ion/Po battery charge process can be divided into 2 main stages:\\
$\bullet$ constant current charge\\
$\bullet$ constant voltage charge\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=3.5]{LiCharge.jpg}
	\caption{ Charge stages \cite{14}}
	\label{fig: EPS}
\end{figure}
 Charging rate of a battery measures in C. In cause of 1000mAh battery cell 1C charging rate will be 1000mA and 500mA for 0.5C. Usually, recommended charging given in the datasheet.\\
 Charging process starts with a 100\%  constant current (according to a charging rate) process. During the time while battery voltage reaching the upper voltage threshold, its pushing a constant current into a battery. Once voltage reaches threshold point, charging process changes from the constant current mode into a constant voltage mode. In a constant voltage mode, voltage keeps its maximum level while current starts to slightly drop until it gets down to a threshold level, which usually written in a datasheet (around 3\%). After current drops below the threshold battery is fully charged. \\ \\
 In most cases, IC chargers are used to provide constant current and constant voltage for lithium-ion / Po batteries. \cite{14} One of those IC chargers is a MAX745. 
This IC is able to set a charge up to 4 cells in series, as well as set a current and charging voltage. This IC use PWM signal to control a charge voltage which does not allowed IC to get too hot.\\ This IC is an example of a charger microchip which has all necessary  tools to charge a Li-ion/Po batteries. 

\newpage

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{MAX745.png}
	\caption{ Li-ion/Po charger MAX745 \cite{15}}
	\label{fig: EPS}
\end{figure}

The figure \ref{fig: EPS} shows an example of a standard MAX745 application circuit. On the left side of the schematics pins SETI and VADJ are used to adjust a charge voltage and charge current. External resistors R16,R12 are connected to a reference voltage to adjust a charge current and resistors R3,R11  used to adjust charge voltage. On the right side of the schematics MAX745 use two external N-channel MOSFETs which control power from the input source which controlled by current mode, PWM controller. \cite{14}"The  heart  of  the  PWM  controller  is  a  multi-input  com-parator.  This  comparator  sums  three  input  signals  to  determine  the  switched  signal’s  pulse  width,  setting  the  battery  voltage  or  current.  The  three  signals  are  the  current-sense  amplifier’s  output,  the  GMV  or  GMI  error  amplifier’s  output,  and  a  slope-compensation  signal  that  ensures that the current-control loop is stable.The   PWM   comparator   compares   the   current-sense   amplifier’s output to the lower output voltage of either the GMV  or  GMI  amplifiers  (the  error  voltage).  This  current-mode feedback reduces the effect of the inductor on the output filter LC formed by the output inductor (L1) and C1 figure \ref{fig: EPS}. This makes stabilizing the circuit much easier, since the output filter changes to a first-order RC from a complex, second-order RLC."

\subsubsection{Protection}

Despite the fact that, Lithium-ion/Po batteries have a high density, they also require a careful handling. For that reason important to use safety protection circuits which prevent Li-ion/Po batteries from: overcharge, over-discharge and quick discharge.\\
\cite{16} Overcharge of a Li-ion/Po batteries cause an immense battery stress which creates a safety hazard with a possibility of fire. Li-ion batteries have a less tolerance to an overcharge and require a protection circuit.\\
The over-discharge of a Lithium batteries is also harmful. The consequence of over-discharge is a reduced battery life, due to the dissolution of copper from the anode into the electrolyte, which can cause a short circuit during a battery charge.\\
Protection ICs used to comply all upper mention conditions. A main principal of a protection IC is to switch on and off a power line usually by using external MOSFETs to keep a batteries safe and not exceed a voltage threshold. The simple example of a protection IC is a BQ29700D which is a one cell protection device. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{protect.png}
	\caption{ BQ29700D protection IC \cite{17}}
	\label{fig: EPS1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig: EPS1} illustrate a typical schematics of a protection circuit where BQ29700 connected with two MOSFETs defined as CHG and DSG, and a battery cell. In cause of overcharge detection, COUT pin pulls a CHG MOSFET which disconnect ground line and stops charging process. In cause ocer-discharge detection, DOUT pin pulls a DSG MOSFET which dissconect ground line and stops discharging process of a battery.

\subsection{Power processing \label{sec:tech}}

Power processing is an important part of an EPS which is responsible for transforming voltages to be suitable for satellite subsystems and payloads. Nowadays there are many converters available; each type has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Hemmo\cite{18} A converter has to be chosen according to subsystem requirements such as voltage range, maximum power output, output voltage tolerance, efficiency and footprint. The power efficiency of a converter is a very important criterion of stored energy due to the fact that battery energy is limited. High efficiency of  power conversion reduces the power dissipation of  components, thereby decreasing the power consumption if batteries. Furthermore, the need for any heat sinks is reduced or altogether eliminated. 

\subsubsection{Linear voltage converters \label{sec:tech}}

Hemmo\cite{18} One of the oldest methods to convert a power is a linear voltage conversion. This method based on power dissipation into a resistor, which cause a voltage drop. Power dissipation of a linear voltage converter can be calculated by using formula:\\ \\

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
P_{diss}=U_{drop} \times I
\end{equation}


where:\\
$U_{drop}$ - resistor voltage drop\\
$I$ - current through a resisor\\ \\
 Linear voltage conversion is a simple method, which does not require many additional passive components, relatively cheap and easy to use. Nonetheless due to a power dissipation linear voltage converters are getting hot, which make them ineffective while current through a resistor is large or difference between $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ is high according to \eqref{eq:2}. For that reason Linear voltage converters used only in cause of low current and low voltage drop for example to convert power into a micro controller or to provide a voltage reference.\\
 \\
 There are two types of linear voltage voltage converters, the shunt converter and the series converter. The simple example of a linear voltage converter is a linear series regulator with a negative feedback. This type of a linear voltage converter based on reference voltage. Reference voltage can be proceed via z-diode from unregulated source voltage.    
 
 
 \begin{figure}[h]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{spannungsteiler.png}
 	\caption{Voltage stabilization with emitter follower}
 	\label{fig: EPS1}
 \end{figure}
 
 Z-diode sets a constant voltage to a base of a NPN transistor. The output voltage can be defined by :
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
 U_{a} = U_{ref} - U_{BE} 
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
 I_{R1} = I_{ref}  + I_{b} 
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:5}
 I_{a} = (\beta +1)I_{B} 
 \end{equation}
 
 Z-diode is influenced by the base current of the NPN transistor which load is divided by a $\beta$ parameter of a NPN transistor. Formula \eqref{eq:4} illustrate that current flowing through R1 resistor equal to the sum of transistor base current and z-diode current. The output current of emitter  $I_{a}$ will be equal \eqref{eq:5} according to a current of the base and its $\beta$ parameter. There are other types of series voltage regulator exists, such as series voltage regulator with feedback.
 
\subsubsection{Inductive DC-DC converters \label{sec:tech}}

Hemmo\cite{18} Each inductive DC-DC converter consist of three passive components: inductor $L$, power switch $S$ and capacitor $C$. The use of these components in various topologies, allow to create various types of DC / DC converters such as a step-down converter where output voltage $U_{a}$  , step-up (step-up) or step-down step-up converter. 






\section{PDU Overview \label{sec:tech}}
Nowadays most of the companies designing their Electrical Power System boards for a nano cubesats as whole unit, consisted of all important devices for power management. This configuration is common and allowed to create space for a hardware in the tiny cubesat which is essential for a nano satellites due to its limited size and mass. 
\\ \\ Despite the fact that mechanical space of the satellite is important, the space on the EPS board is also limited for a components which is limiting satellite possibilities with bigger missions and more developed bus.  

\section{Technologies \label{sec:tech}}

One unit configuration is a common type of an EPS design, which is mostly used by nano cubesat developers. This type of EPS design allowed to combine all components of the EPS in one unit to save mechanical space for the rest of the bus hardware and a payload of a nano cubesat. Second type of technology is a separated type of the EPS which is divided in to Power Processing Unit (PPU) which is responsible for a power generation from a solar panels, battery charging and balancing as well as power processing and power convertation and Power Distribution Unit (PDU) which has a function of the power distribution. PDU consist mostly of switchers and current sensors, this architecture allowed to place significant amount of switchers and connectors for a payloads, which are necessary for a missions requiring amount of payload connections which will not be enough for a standard one unit EPS board type. \\
\\


\subsection{Load research\label{sec:aaa}}

Due to the one of the requirements, to make PDU universal for all types of buses and payloads, development of the PDU require to have a detailed research of the newest bus and payload components and devices which are more likely to be used on the future satellites.\\
\\
 Considering that PDU distribute power to the bus and payload, one of the main requirements is to set a PDU to be able to handle different loads of a bus and payload. To accomplish this requirements it is necessary to know how much power each subsystem consume. Taking in to account that nano satallites produce usually from 2 to 22 W of power, depending on the satellite configuration, amount of payloads and subsystems are limited. \\
 \\
 Here is a list of possible components for a subsystems with a power consumption, which can be considered as relevant. \\ \\ \\ \\

Exmple: Tim-Berners-Lee describes the ''WorldWideWeb'' as follows:
\\
\textit{''The WorldWideWeb (W3) is a wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents.''} \cite{timwww}
\\
\\
You can also cite different claims about the same term.
\\
According to Bill Gates \textit{''Windows 7 is the best operating system that has ever been released''} \cite{billgates} (no real quote)
In opposite Steve Jobs claims Leopard to be \textit{''the one and only operating system''} \cite{stevejobs}

If the topic you are talking about can be grouped into different categories you can start with a classification.
Example: According to Tim Berners-Lee XYZ can be classified into three different groups, depending on foobar \cite{timwww}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Mobile X
				\vspace{-0.1in} 
		\item Fixed X
				\vspace{-0.1in} 
		\item Combined X
 	\end{itemize}
