The Electrical Power System is a critical element for the success of a space mission. The main responsibilities of an Electrical Power System (EPS) are the generation, control and distribution of energy for a satellite during its mission. Depending on mission specifics, the EPS is responsible for handling different power busses and loads and shall provide robust power channels to all spacecraft subsystems and payload. The Electrical Power System is also responsible for housekeeping information collection and analysis. 
\\

Current work is dedicated to the development of a new EPS for a 6 Unit CubeSat. The preliminary idea is to divide the EPS into two modules: Power Distribution (PDU) and Power Processing Unit (PPU). While the PPU will be responsible for battery charging, energy conversion from the solar cells and power processing, PDU will be in charge of control and power monitoring. The present work will cover an architectural design of a whole system, while the main focus will be on the design of a Power Distribution Unit, which will be adjustable for different missions and responsible for a power handling.
\\

This thesis aims to provide a full design iteration of a PDU of the 6 Unit CubeSat EPS. It will start with a power budget analysis of the 6U satellite. After that, the architecture of the EPS distribution board will be reviewed. From the design side, the electrical circuit and PCB of the PDU will be developed, manufactured and tested.
